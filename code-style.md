# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Follow language-specific naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python)
- Prefix boolean variables with 'is', 'has', or 'should'
- Use UPPERCASE for constants

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Limit nesting levels to improve readability
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Group related code together
- Avoid duplicate code by extracting common functionality

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- Use docstrings or equivalent for functions, classes, and modules
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples in documentation when appropriate

## 4. Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for error-prone code
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes

## 5. Performance
- Optimize critical sections of code for performance
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Minimize database queries and API calls
- Implement caching where beneficial

## 6. Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep sensitive information out of code repositories

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components
- Implement integration tests for system interactions
- Maintain high test coverage
- Run tests regularly and before deployments

## 8. Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new development
- Review code before merging into main branches
- Keep commits small and focused

## 9. Code Reviews
- Conduct thorough code reviews
- Provide constructive feedback
- Address all comments before merging
- Use automated tools to catch common issues
